## Course website: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su20/
### Course Description
CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.
CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to the task of exploring the topics taught in this course. Also, this course use two other languages in the latter half of the course: the Scheme programming language and the Structured Query Language (SQL).

### Course Project
There are four projects through the eight week of summer session. It's a really interesting course for students to develop logical thinking. The purpose of the course is to learn concepts involved in programming.

Hog Description:
In this project, students need to use control statements and higher-order functions together individually or with group to develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog. 

Cat Description:
In this project, students will write a program that measures typing speed individually or with group. Additionally, you will implement typing autocorrect, which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it. This project is inspired by typeracer.

Ants Description:ï¼ˆneed to change)
In this project, you will create a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees individually or with group. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.
This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, focusing on the material from Chapter 2.5 of Composing Programs. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program
