## Course Description
CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware. CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to the task of exploring the topics taught in this course. Also, this course use two other languages in the latter half of the course: the Scheme programming language and the Structured Query Language (SQL).

## Course Project
There are four projects through the eight week of summer session. It's a really interesting course for students to develop logical thinking. The purpose of the course is to learn concepts involved in programming.

### Hog Description:
In this project, students  individually or with group need to use control statements and higher-order functions together to develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog.

### Cat Description:
In this project, students will  individually or with group write a program that measures typing speed. Additionally, students will implement typing autocorrect, which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it. This project is inspired by typeracer.

### Ants Description:
In this project, students will individually or with a group create a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.
This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.

### Scheme Description:
In this project, students will individually or with group develop an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. Also, students will implement some small programs in Scheme. Scheme is a simple but powerful functional language. Students should find that much of what you have learned about Python transfers cleanly to Scheme as well as to other programming languages.

## Class Summary
CS 61A is a basic logical thinking course. It not only focuses on python language but also develops students' ideas on thinking computer science. When students looked at the questions, they will take a few days to what the problems said. They need to implement their ideas in code just like a computer. Also, by learning the concepts involved in programming, there are several ways to do one coding problem. It's a good course for students who want to understand the basic concepts of programming, such as control statements, higher-order functions, functional and object-oriented programming. Also, in order to make students have new tries, the course assigned the new language, such as Scheme programming language and SQL. As we all know, learning SQL is a simple way for the programming commands to collect and update the information when needed. In addition, by completing these projects, my logical thinking made me organized things and process data conveniently.
